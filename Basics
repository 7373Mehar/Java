Set of programs is called application
Remember every program has a file.In java that file is .class file
This file is created by compiler

Program
-------
It is set of methods.These methods are called by program to perform operation.Source code of the program will be written by you and it should be saved into .java file
This file is called source code file
This file will be given to the compiler and compiler will generate .class file after compilation

Compilation:Generating executable code from the source code is called compilation.This is done by compiler
In java this code is kept into one another file known as class file

Method
------
It is set of executable commands/instructions/statements
These commands are executed/run in a sequence to perform a specific task
when method is called

public class AA
