String 
-------
It is set of characters or array of characters
"8810436567"
"rehanahmad9919@gmail.com"
"Rehan Ahmad"

char type array is required to keep string in memory
In java this array will be created autometically,It means code to create array is predefined.Following three classes have this code
1)String class
2)StringBuffer class
3)StringBuilder class
These classes are in java.lang package

We need to write code to create object of these classes to store string
String str1=new String("Rehan Ahmad");
StringBuffer str2=new StringBuffer("8810436567");
StringBuilder str3=new StringBuilder("rehanahmad9919@gmail.com");

public String toString()
-------------------------
It is a method of Object class.Remember Object class is parent of every class in java.So every java class has this method
This method is called autometically when reference variable name is passed to the println() or print() method
In this case value returned by toString() method will be displayed/shown
tostring() method of Object class always returns combination following value

1)Classname
2)@
3)Hexadecimal value of object's hashcode
