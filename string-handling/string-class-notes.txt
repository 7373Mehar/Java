String class
------------
It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable
It means string stored by String class object can not be modified/changed
Remember StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable
StringBuffer is synchronized class while StringBuilder is non-synchronized class

Remember object of String class is created autometically for each string value
This object is created in string constant pool area(it is also called intern pool)
Remember object using new keyword is created in heap area
Only one object of Stirng class is created for same string value

String str1="It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable";
String str2="It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable";
String str3="It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable";
String str4="It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable";
String str5="It is an immutable class.Immutable means non-modifiable";

Only one object of String class will be created for above string and reference of that object will be stored by each variable(str1,str2,str2,str4 and str5)
