Life cycle of threads
---------------------
Life cycle of the thread is managed by thread-schedular.Thread-schedular is a component of JVM
It is dependenct upon OS-schedular
Life cycle of thread has following five phases

1)New thread:When thread is created(object is created)
2)Runnable:When thread is started(start() method is called).Multiple threads can be in this state
3)Running:when it gets chance for execution.Only one thread can be in this state at a time.In this phase run() method is called
4)Non-runnable:We can send a running thread into this state.There will be pause in the execution of running thread.We can call methods for this
5)Terminated :When execution of run method over.
