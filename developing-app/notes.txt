Developing application
-----------------------
As we know an application can have following three layers
1)Presentation layer
2)Business layer
3)Data layer

Developing presentation layer of the application
-------------------------------------------------
This layer is also known as UI(User interface)
To develop this UI we will use following two APIs
1)Swing API
2)AWT(Abstract windowning tooklit) API

Every UI consists of components(such as frame,button,textboxes,passwordbox,checkbox,labels)
Our program will create objects for these components
Code ot create objects should be written by you

import packagename.classname;
or
import packagename.*;

We will use classes of following two packages in GUI
1)javax.swing
b)java.awt

Component		Class in swing package
----------		--------------------
frame			JFrame
button			JButton
textbox			JTextField
passwordbox		JPasswordField
label			JLabel
checkbox		JCheckBox


JFrame
------
It is main component of GUI.
Object of this class will be used as frame/window of the GUI

JFrame fr=new JFrame();
