Event
-----
Performing task by application on user interaction is event
Remember user will interact with component of UI
This component will be called event source
To perform the task we will have to define/override method
This method will be called event handler
(This method is already defined(inside interface) without implementation and calling code of this method is also defined)
Remember method is overrideen inside s class, so we will have to make this class also.This class will be called event listener
This class should be defined by implementing one of the following interface
1)ActionListener interface
2)MouseListener interface
3)KeyListener interface
etc
java.awt.event package contains these interface
(We can define listener class inside our UI class)

Note:Event handler(method) will be called by event source(component)
We will have to give reference of listener class object to the event source
This is called registration of listener with source
