1)Override run() method of Runnable interface
2)Create threads
3)Start threads


Thread class has already implemented Runnable interface, so we can ovverride run() method by inheriting from Thread class too

public class Task extends Thread
{
  public void run()
  {
	//code
  }
}

Task th=new Task();
th.start();

-----------
For evrery java program, JVM creates and starts a thread.This thread is called main thread.This thread has responsibility to call main() method of java program
