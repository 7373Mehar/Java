Thread
------
It is smallest unit of processing.Our multitasking program will create and start thread.Every thread is represented in the form of objects.
Code to create this object should be written by you.
java.lang.Thread class object or it's child class object should be created as a thread

Thread th=new Thread();//It will create a thread
or
class AA extends Thread
{
 //code
}
AA th=new AA();//It will create a thread

After write code to create thread, write code to start thread
th.start();
start() is a method of Thread class

Before creating and starting thread, you will have to override run() method of java.lang.Runnale interface
In this method you will have to write code(Task that will be performed by each thread)

public class Task implements Runnable
{
  public void run()
  {
	//code to perform task
  }
}

After overriding run() method write code to create thread and start thread in your application class
Thread th=new Thread(new Task());
th.start();
