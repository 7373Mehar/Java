Interface
----------
As we know every class is a structute
Similary interface is also structure
Class is used by program to create object
But interface can not be used to create object

"*Classes implements interfaces*"
"*All methods inside interface would be abstract and public by default*"

public interface AA
{
  public abstract void method1();
  public void method1();
  abstract void method1();
  void method1();
}

"*All abstract methods inside interface can be public only*"
