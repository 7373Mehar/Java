Abstraction
-----------
Hiding non-essential details of the entity/object from the user is called abstraction
In programming hiding complexity/implementation of thhe method is called abstraction
It is achieved by following two ways

1)By defining abstract class
2)By defining interface

Abstract method
----------------
Those methods that do not have body/implementation are known as abstract methods

public abstract return-type method-name(argument-list);

public abstract void findShapeArea();

Rule:Abstract methods can be defined only inside abstract class or inside interface
