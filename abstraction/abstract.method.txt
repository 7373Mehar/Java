Abstract class
--------------
Those classes that can not be instantiated are known as abstract classes
Concrete class:The class that can be instantiated
Final class:The class that can not be inherited

It means object from abstract class can not be created
Abstract class is always used as a parent
Abstract class should be defined when we want to define abstract methods inside class
Rule:Abstract methods will be overridden by child classes
