Implementation of interface
---------------------------
We will have to define a class by implementing interface.
In this class we will have to override all abstract methods of that interface
public interface AA
{
  void method1();
}
public class BB imlements AA
{
}

Here class BB is implementation class of interface AA
All abstract methods of interface must be overriden by implementation class

"* A class can implement more than one interfaces *"
public interface AA
{
}
public interface BB
{
}
public class CC implements AA,BB
{
}

"* A class can extend and implement both*"
public class AA
{
}
public interface BB
{
}
public class CC extends AA implements BB
{
}

"* An interface can extend multiple interfaces*"
public interface AA
{
}
public interface BB
{
}
public interface CC extends AA,BB
{
}
